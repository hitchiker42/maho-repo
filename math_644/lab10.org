1.
1. Welches two sample t-test. (aka approximate t-test)
2. Null: The true means of the two populations are equal
   Alt : The true means of the two populations are unequal
3. Normality: Random sampling was use, n is large-ish
              (n = 15, which is a bit small)
   Equal variance: The samples are from seperate populations,
                   so the variances are unequal.
4.
test statistic is from the t-distribution, see below for formula/value
#+BEGIN_SRC R
type.1 = c(206, 193, 192, 188, 207, 210, 205, 185, 194,
           187, 189, 178, 194, 213, 205);


type.2 = c(177, 176, 198, 197, 185, 188, 206, 200, 189,
           201, 197, 203, 180, 192, 192);
ts = (mean(type.1)-mean(type.2))/
       (sqrt((var(type.1)/length(type.1))+(var(type.2)/length(type.2))));
#ts = 1.19
t.test(type.1,type.2)
#+END_SRC
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
R output:
Welch Two Sample t-test
data:  type.1 and type.2
t = 1.19, df = 27.698, p-value = 0.2441
alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval:
 -3.129368 11.796035
sample estimates:
mean of x mean of y
 196.4000  192.0667
#+END_EXAMPLE
5,6. p value = 0.2441, So we fail to reject the null hypothesis since the p
value is greater than the significance level.
7. with 95% confidence The true means of the two populations are equal.
8. see above 

2.
1. Paired t-test
2. Null: The true mean of the differencs of the population before
         and after the process is not 0
   Alt: The true mean of the differencs of the population before
        and after the process is 0
3. Normality: Not satisified, no evidence random sampling was
   used, also n is pretty small, greater than 5, but still small.
3. The test statistic is from the t distribution, see below for the
   formula and value
#+BEGIN_SRC R
before = c(215, 226, 226, 219, 222, 231, 234, 219, 209, 216)
after = c(203, 216, 217, 211, 215, 218, 224, 210, 201, 207)
differences = before-after
ts = mean(differences)/(sd(differences)/sqrt(length(differences)))
#ts = 16.319
t.test(before,after,paired=TRUE)
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
R output:
Paired t-test
data:  before and after
t = 16.319, df = 9, p-value = 5.414e-08
alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval:
  8.183104 10.816896
sample estimates:
mean of the differences
                    9.5
#+END_EXAMPLE
4,5. p value â‰ˆ 0, so we reject the null hypothesis since the p value is less
than the significance level.
6. With 95% confidence the true difference in means is not equal to 0
