1. We need to know if the distribution is approximately normal, the different
   tests used in hypothesis testing (t-test, z-test, etc...) only work for
   normally distributed data.   
2. The data seems roughly normal, the plots aren't perfectly normal, but they
   seem close enough to normal that using the normal distribution is a good estimate.

3.	One Sample z-test\\
Data:  lead.diam\\
\alpha = 0.01\\
z = -1.497\\
n = 20.0000000\\
test statistic: sample mean = 1/20 * sum(lead.diam)\\
mean of lead.diam (sample mean): 0.493305\\
Std. Dev. = 0.0200000\\
Std. Dev. of the sample mean = 0.0044721\\
p-value = 0.1344 = P(Z<-1.497)*2\\
null hypothesis: true mean is equal to 0.5\\
alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 0.5\\
99 percent confidence interval: 0.4817855 0.5048245\\

p-value >> \alpha, so we fail to reject the null hypothesis

4. See data in part 2 for 99% confidence interval.
   The 99% confidence interval is the interval in which 99% of values will fall
   in, that is we are 99% confident that a value will fall within 0.4817855 and
   0.5048245
