1.
a. Observational study, Data is being collected for the study, and there is no
   control group.
b. Columbus, Ohio residents
c. The 25 people interviewed
d. Interviewing people going to a baseball game. Incredibly flawed since people
   actually going to a baseball game are likely biased in favor of a new stadium.

2.
a. People with gastric ulcers
b. the 160 patients involved in the study

3.
a. It's debateable, either all people, or all dental patients, probably the
   latter
b. The two groups where randomly chosen to ensure they represented an accurate
   sample of the population, letting people choose the group would create
   biases sample groups, and so could not be allowed.
c. Yes, instead of comparing two groups the results could be compared to the
   ammount of decay between past dental examinations. The method uses might
   lead to better data, but comparing to past restults would still lead to
   valid data.

4.
a. No, for various reasons, one of the prominate one's being it's impossible to
   file a warranty claim for a fatal crash.
b. Retrospective, past data is being analyzed.
