Question 1:\\
\Theta_1 = 1/9 * sum(X_i,i=1..9)\\
\Theta_2 = 1/2 * (3X_1 - X_6 + 2X_4)\\
Expected Value = 1/9 * sum(X_i,i=1..9)\\

Bias of \Theta_1 is 0;\\
Bias of \Theta_2 = X_1(1/9 - 3/2) + X_6(1/9 + 1/2) + X_4(1/9 - 1) +
                  X_{2,3,5,7,8,9}
                = -25/19*X_1 + 11/18 * X_6 + -8/9 *X_4 + 1/9(X_{2,3,5,7,8,9})\\
\Theta_1 is best\\

NOTE:\\
For the following:\\
Define the function for the margin of error,\\
MOE(\alpha, n, \sigma) = P(Z < (1 - \alpha/2)) * \sigma/sqrt(n)\\


Question 2:\\
n = 1500$/10$ = 150\\
\sigma = 14\\
\alpha = 0.10\\
margin of error = MOE(\alpha, n, \sigma) = 0.9475618\\

Question 3:\\
n = 63\\

\alpha = 0.10\\

1. Yes, n is large and random sampling was used.
2. margin of error = MOE(\alpha, n, \sigma) = 0.2088742
3. 100.3911 - 100.8089
4. 90% of the time the population mean will lie in between
   100.3911 and 100.8089
5. 11, see below for R code used to find this

#+BEGIN_SRC R
MOE = function(a, n, o){pnorm(1 - \alpha/2) * (o/sqrt(n))};

Question 4:\\
n = 50\\
\sigma = 0.2\\
X_bar = 4.10\\
\mu = 4.00\\
\alpha = 0.01\\

1. Yes, n > 30 and random sampling was used
2. Null: Mean battery life is less than or equal to 4 hours
   Alt : Mean battery life is greater than 4 hours
3. ts = (X_bar - \mu)/(\sigma/sqrt(n)) = 3.535534
4. Critical value = P(Z > (1-\alpha)) = 0.8389129
5. Reject the null hypothesis since the test statistic
   is greater than the critical value
6. We are 99% confident that the mean battery life is greater than 4 hours 
7. p = P(Z > 3.535534) = 0.0002034759
8. 0.2882239
9. 181, see below for R code used to calculate 8 and 9

pow.z = function(a,d,s,n){
          1-pnorm((qnorm(1-a) - (d/(s/sqrt(n)))))

Question 5:\\
NOTE: See section following answers for R code used to calculate statistics
1. no, n<30
2. Null: Mean Izod impact strength is less than 1
   Alt : Mean Izod impact strength is greater than 1
3. 1.6498
4. cv = 0.8326924
5. reject the null hypothesis since the test stastic is greater than the critical value
6. Mean Izod impact strength is greater than 1
