Question 1:\\
R-Code:
#+BEGIN_SRC R
voltage = c(9.099, 9.174, 9.327, 9.377, 8.471, 9.575, 
            9.514, 8.928, 8.800, 8.920, 9.913, 8.306)
png("qqplot.png")
qqnorm(voltage, main = "Q-Q Plot")
qqline(voltage);
dev.off()
png("hist.png")
hist(voltage)
dev.off()
#+END_SRC
The histogram mostly follows a bell curve, but there aren't enough samples for
it to appear truely normal, nonetheless it seems a normal approximation should
be ok. The Q-Q plot is much more definitive, it shows the data matches up with
the normal quantiles almost perfectly.

Question 2:\\
R-Code:
#+BEGIN_SRC R
voltage = c(9.099, 9.174, 9.327, 9.377, 8.471, 9.575, 
            9.514, 8.928, 8.800, 8.920, 9.913, 8.306)
t.test(voltage, mu = 9, conf.level = 0.95, alternative = "two.sided")
#+END_SRC
#+BEGIN_VERBATIM
Output:
	One Sample t-test

data:  voltage
t = 0.87385, df = 11, p-value = 0.4009
alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 9
95 percent confidence interval:
 8.822309 9.411691
sample estimates:
mean of x 
    9.117 
#+END_VERBATIM
The Null hypothesis is that the population mean voltage is equal to 9.
The Alternative hypothesis is that the population mean voltage is not equal
to 9. The significance level is 0.05. Since the p-value is 0.4009, which is
much higher than the significance level we fail to reject the Null hypothesis.

\\
Question 3:
#+BEGIN_VERBATIM
α = 0.05
power = 0.1711521
β = 1 - power = 0.8288479;
δ = 0.317
s = 12
#+END_VERBATIM
R-Code:
#+BEGIN_SRC R
power.t.test(delta = abs(mean(voltage)-8.8), power = 0.95,
             sd = sd(voltage), sig.level = 0.05, type = "one.sample")
#+END_SRC
#+BEGIN_VERBATIM
Output:

     One-sample t test power calculation 

              n = 29.81338
          delta = 0.317
             sd = 0.4638101
      sig.level = 0.05
          power = 0.95
    alternative = two.sided

#+END_VERBATIM
Question 4:\\
R-Code:
#+BEGIN_SRC R
samples=seq(2,100)
power = power.t.test(n = samples, delta = 3,
sig.level = 0.05, type = "one.sample", sd = 4.5)[["power"]]
min.samples = Position(function(x){x>=0.9},power) + 1
png("sample_power.png")
plot(samples, power, main = "Samples vs Power")
dev.off()
cat(sprintf("Minimum samples by plot = %d\nActual mininum samples = %f\n",
              min_samples, power.t.test(n=NULL, delta = 3, sd = 4.5,
                                        type = "one.sample", power = 0.90)[["n"]]))
#+END_SRC
#+BEGIN_VERBATIM
Output:
Minimum samples by plot = 26
Actual mininum samples = 25.639898
#+END_VERBATIM
