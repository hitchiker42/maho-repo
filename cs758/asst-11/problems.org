26.1-6:
Given a graph, a start vertex and an end vertex is it possible to find two 
paths from the start to the end, given by the sets of edges P1 and P2 such
that P1 \cap P2 = \empty. Show how to formulate this problem as a maximum flow problem


26.2-6:
Suppose each source s[i] in a flow network with multiple sources and sinks
produces exactly  p[i] units of flow so that 
p[i] = sum(f(s[i],v) for each v in V). Suppose also each sink t[j] consumes
exactly q[j] units so that q[j] = sum(f(v,t[j]) foreach v in V) and
sum(p[i]) = sum(q[j]). Show how to convert the problem of finding a flow f
that obeys these constraints into a problem of finding a maximum flow in
a single-source,single-sink flow network.


26-1 part a:
Given an NxN matrix M let a graph G(V,E) be formed such that V=M[i][j] for
i,j=0...N and E = M[i][j] - M[i+/-1][j+/-1], other than the edges.

given m starting points, such that m <= n^2, (x1,y1),(x2,y2)...(xm,ym) on the
grid the escape problem is to determine whether or not there are m
