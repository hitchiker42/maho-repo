* Factorial Powers
 x^{<n>} = \prod_{m=o}^{n-1} (x - m) when n > 0
 x^{<n>} = 1/(\prod_{m=1}^{n} (x + m)) when n < 0
 x^{<n>} = 1 when n = 0
 or recursively
 x^{<0>} = 1
 x^{<n+1>} = x^{<n>}(x - n)


 given the
 For n > 0 these are the falling factorial powers
 if n < 0 these are x*1/rising factorial powers

We define these so that \Delta{}x^{<n>} = (x^n)'
i.e \Delta{}x^{<n>} = n*x^{<n-1>} \forall{}n \in N
* Deltas of trig functions
  d/dx sin(ax)  = a*cos(ax)
  \Delta sin(ax) = sin(a(x+1)) - sin(ax)
            = sin(ax+a) - sin(ax)
            = sin(ax)cos(a) + cos(ax)sin(a) - sin(ax)
            = sin(ax)(cos(a) - 1) + cos(ax)sin(a)
  \Delta cos(ax) = cos(a(x+1)) - cos(ax)
            = cos(ax+a) - cos(ax)
            = cos(ax)cos(a) - sin(ax)sin(a) - cos(ax)
            = cos(ax)(cos(a) - 1) - sin(ax)sin(a)
  \Delta \Delta cos(ax) = (cos(ax)(cos(a) - 1) - sin(ax)sin(a))(cos(a)-1) -
                (sin(ax)(cos(a) - 1) + cos(ax)sin(a))(sin(a))

* Solving inequalities 
let f:Z^{+}->R 
f is increasing at x iff f(x) < f(x+1) iff \Delta{}f(x) > 0
f is decreasing ax x iff f(x) > f(x+1) iff \Delta{}f(x) < 0
f is constant at x iff f(x) = f(x) iff \Delta{}f(x) = 0
This isn't so simple with calculus (we need the mean value theorem)

define \Delta^{2}f = \Delta\Delta{}f and \Delta^{n}f = \Delta(\Delta^{n-1}f)

We can use this to solve inequalities:
ex: show x^2 \leq 2^x
let f = 2^x-x^2, find all x such that f(x) \ge 0
# the second and third delta's are probably extranous for this
# but that's not always the case
at \Delta{}f = 2^x - 2x + 1( and \Delta^{2}f = 2^x -2 and \Delta^{3}f = 2^x = \Delta^{n}f)
\Delta{}f > 0 \forall{}x>2, and f > 0 \forall{}x\ge{}4

from now on let dx == \Delta{}x unless otherwise specifiex

solve x^3 + 5x^2 + 7 < 3^x for x\in{}N
lim x -> \infty 3^x > x^3

* solving inequalities for rational functions
let p(x) be a polynomial of degree n with real number coefficents
p(r) = 0 iff \exists{}q s.t. p(x) = (x-r)q(x) (factor theorem)
More generally p(x)/(x-a) = q(x) + p(a)

We can write any polynomial of degree n as 
p(x) = C_n \prod_{i=0}^{m}(x-r_i) * g(x), where r_i is the i'th real root of p, m is
the number of real roots of p and g(x) is a polynomial of degree n with no real
roots. g(x) > 0 \forall{}x, x\in R
sign(p(x)) == sign(C_N*\prod_{i=0}^m(x-r_i))

* Sign picture
Simply a graph indicating the sign of a function over it's domain.

Fairly easy to write down for a polynomial, assuming you can factor it 

ex: given f(x) = (x-1)^2(x-2)^3(x-3)^10(x-4)^5
sign:  - | + | - | - | +
x:       1   2   3   4
