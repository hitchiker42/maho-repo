Project information

Tell us about the project you'd like to pursue.

Title: Integration of Incanter and Core.Matrix

Synopsis: Incanter is an R like statistical library for clojure and Core.Matrix
is an api for matrix operations in clojure

Give us a brief 1-2
paragraph description of your project, including details such as the problem
you are trying to resolve and how you plan on solving it.  Qualifications: What
experience do you have that prepares you to undertake this project?  Community
benefits: How would your project help the Clojure community?  Deliverables:
What quantifiable results should your project produce?  Schedule: See below.:

GSoC officially runs from 17 Junâ€“23 Sep, a period of 14 weeks.  Please create a
detailed plan about what you hope to accomplish over this time, ideally in 1-
to 2- week segments.  This plan serves two primary purposes:

    It shows us to what degree you have considered the problem.  We will be
    able to see if the schedule seems realistic and well-considered.  If
    selected, it will serve as a way to track your progress over the summer.
    Granted, we all know that schedules can slip due to surprises within the
    project, and so long as you show consistent progress you will be fine.

Other commitments

As a GSoC student, you will be paid by Google to be doing full-time work on
your project.  As such, we need to know:

    Does the GSoC conflict with exams at your university?  If so, we can be
    flexible and adjust your project's schedule accordingly.  The important
    thing is to let us know early.  Do you have any other significant summer
    plans?  Are you getting married, going on vacation, or expecting to start a
    job?  If so, please tell us how this will impact your project and how you
    plan to handle it.  Are you applying to any other internships (outside of
    GSoC) or summer employment?  If there is a good chance you will decline an
    offer to work on a Clojure GSoC project in preference for something else,
    please let us now.

Other information

    Why Clojure?  We are curious.  How did you hear about Clojure and GSoC?
    Have you developed or contributed to open source projects?  If so, please
    tell us which ones and provide links.  Are you applying as a student to
    another GSoC organization?  If so, please let us know.  This will not
    impact your application with Clojure, but will help us out in the event
    that you are selected by us and someone else.
