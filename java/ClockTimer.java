 * of milliseconds.  Clock timers should not drift: the task should
 * start after a fixed delay from the <em>beginning</em> of the
 * previous run, not the end.
 *

 * and {@link #start}, methods {@link #stop} and {@link #cancel}
 do
 * not throw an {@code IllegalStateException}.  They simply have no
 * effect when called at the wrong time.
