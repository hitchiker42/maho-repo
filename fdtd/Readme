Finite Differance Time Domain program. Run make to create a program fdtd which
runs with the default constants. If you wish to modify the constants use the
gen_consts program which is generated as part of the build. If you wish to
build a non multithreaded implementation add -DNOT_MULTI_THREAD to CFLAGS when
running make.
