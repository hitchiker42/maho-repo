\section{Introduction}
A program for soving the Korteweg-de-Vires partial differential equation
A one dimensional equation used (among other things) to model shallow waves,
in this case u is the height of the water above the sea floor
The equation has the form:
\[\partial_tu+\partial_x^3u-6u\partial_xu=0\]
The solver uses finite-differences in space to discretize the problem
Periodic boundary conditions are used such that the fields satisify:
u(x+Ln) = u(x,y) for all integers n; this implies the grid has a domain of
[0:L] with spacial steps \Delta x=L/mx, where mx is the number of points
the periodic boundary conditions imply that for at a boundary n where
normally n-2,n-1,n,n+1,n+2 would be used to calculate n we use
n-2,n-1,n,0,1
